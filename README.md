# Amaca4Shoes
An innovative shoe rack concept: it is modular and easy to assemble, thanks to the 3D printed rods that can be fixed to the wall; it can be also customized with the preferred cloth.

Amaca4Shoes is composed of a series of modular components, including different rods 3D printed, on which to set pieces of cloth that, suitably adjusted, will act as a container for the shoes. It will be possible to create a customized system, suitable for any type of shoe, but also for the size of any room and any house, depending on the length of the cloth and the position of the rods.  The rod is designed in two different ways: a 30 cm one (composed of two parts to be assembled) and a 15 cm one, in order to insert the shoes laterally, to reduce the thickness of the shoe rack. One of the distinguishing features of the object is the possibility of keeping the shoes in an open space, avoiding the creation of stagnant zones and the permanence of smells. There is also the chance to wash the cloth or change it easily, without having to disassemble the whole shoe rack. The rod is designed to simplify the assembly, using interlocking elements  to reduce the purchase of materials and tools.
